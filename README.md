# Data Visualizations

## Aim of the project

This project's aim is to further our knowledge in Data Visualization and AI/ML. We've programmed several different *interactable* visualizations of data of different complexities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Installing

To install, download and extract this this project into an empty folder. In order to run, the project must be hosted on a server or any program that has a 'live preview' mode.

There are a couple visualizations will take time to load due to the sheer size of some data being loaded. 

## Browser requirements

1. Browser WEB-GL Support
2. Compatible browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

### Visualization 1 

Visualizes diversity (by race) in the technology sector.

### Visualization 2

Visualizes diversity (by gender) in the technology sector.

### Visualization 3

Visualizes pay gap in the technology sector. It's incomplete as it's lacking several labels.

### Visualization 4

Visualizes the average difference between male and female pay in the tech sector.

### Visualization 5

Visualizes temperature fluctuations through the years, starting from 1880 up to 2010.

### Visualization 6

Visualizes average intake as a percentage of weighted reference nutrient intake.

### Visualization 7

Visualizes anonymised opinions about food using a pie chart.

### Visualization 8

Visualizes different country's energy production by fuel source such as coal, nuclear, and renewables. 
Uses a squarified tree visualization algorithm that allows for displaying of hiercharcal data.

### Visualization 9

Flood map visualization that uses a shallow neural network to calculate the rate of change of sea level rise over the years using data provided by NASA. It then allows one to scroll through the years and see how the rising sea impacts different regions around the world, and which areas will most likely be flooded.

Two different visualizations are nested within one another. The graph can be accessed by navigating to the left corner of the first visualization. Both are fully interactive.

### Visualization 10

Three-dimensional visualization of population density around the world. Peaks represent areas where there is a high population density.
